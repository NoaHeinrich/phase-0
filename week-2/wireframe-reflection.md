What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is a crude mockup of the website you are designing. It is essentially the blueprint of the website, showing only the barest details of what will be going on. This can be done by hand, or with a number of software that specializes in this.

What are the benefits of wireframing?
The benefit of wireframing is that you have something concrete to work from before you begin coding. This is especially important if you're designing a website for a client, as you can show them your work, and get their feedback on the design. Additionally, designing a website without any prior planning could very easily lead you into trouble. With a wireframe, you can spot any usability issues before you do the real work.

Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
I did enjoy wireframing. The program I decided to use, Cacoo, is simple and easy to use. The only issue I had was that I still don't know exactly what this website will be for, besides acting as a profile.

Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
The instructions told us not to spend too much time wireframing, so I made sure to stick with my original idea. I could have very easily gone through several iterations, but I wanted to keep it simple. The final product reminds me of 2000s era angelfire, but it'll do.

What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
The main question I had was how to save an exact size for a page, as stated in the Beginner's Guide to Wireframing. Cacoo doesn't have that option, apparently. I eventually realized that I have time to worry about that when I get some real professional software. When I have money for Illustrator, I'll have this page saved to show me how to do this additional step.

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I enjoyed wireframing, and experimenting with the software available to help you. It was a lot of fun to imagine and design a simple website, without having to worry about the html for now. The tedious part was formatting the wireframes I made, so that they at least resembled something you could put online. Like I said earlier, I decided not to worry about resolution and size for now, but I ended up spending too much time on that concept.
