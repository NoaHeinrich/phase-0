What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
The six phases of Web Design are Information Gathering, Planning, Design, Development, Testing and Delivery, and Maintenance. In other words, you must first figure out what sort of website you hope to make. Then you must make a map of how users will navigate the website. Then you design the look and feel of your website, and how users will interact with it. Then you do the actual coding to make your design into reality. Next you create multiple versions of the site, to make sure it does what you want and functions across multiple platforms. Finally, you put systems in place to keep the site running, which also allow you to edit the website as you see fit in the future.

What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
My site's primary purpose, other than to practice my newfound HTML skills, is to create a profile for myself, both as a coder and a writer. It will have a short biography, my contact information, and samples of my work. It will also have additional content that I have yet to plan out.
What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My site's target audience is potential hirers and/or publishers. In interest of this, it will be a pleasant-looking but professional website. Think of it as a digital business card, one that makes me look appealing without too many bells and whistles.
What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
I would like them to primarily see my portfolio, and ideally contact me afterwards to offer large amounts of money. There wont be a lot of information on the site as of yet, just my profile, information, and samples of work, so there doesn't really need to be a search feature yet. But in the future, who knows?
What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
When designing a website, like any other product, one should try to tailor it to the users' needs. In other words, when designing, you should try to anticipate your users' needs. It may be tempting to make your website in the simplest possible way, but that isn't always the best way.
What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 
User experience design is the way your website makes a user feel. This includes its usability, aesthetics, performance, and accessibility, among other things. In other words, user experience design is the study of all of the things that go into a website, and how they affect a potential user. It is important because your website is like a business, whether or not you're actually selling anything. If your user experience design is poor, then your users wont want to come back.
Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
It took me longer than I care to admit to make sense of Markdown. The challenge made it sound like this was in a prior lesson, so I felt a little stupid for not having known it already. It took me a few tries to get the hang of, but I eventually made sense of it.
