# Person 4 - Noah Heinrich
#Pseudocode
# Accepts array and letter
# iterate through array
# for each element, search for letter
# if element contains letter, delete element

def my_array_deletion_method!(source, thing_to_delete)
  source.delete_if{|word| word.to_s.include?(thing_to_delete)}
end

#Pseudocode
#Accepts hash and key
# iterate through hash
# if key matches inputted key, delete key and value

def my_hash_deletion_method!(source, thing_to_delete)
  source.delete_if{|pet, age| pet==thing_to_delete}
end

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# I implemented the delete_if method. It iterates through an array or a hash, and will delete any element that matches a certain requirement. In the first case, it deleted any element that contained a given string. In the second, it deleted any hashes that matched the inputted key.

# Release 1: Identify and describe the Ruby method you implemented. Teach your
# accountability group how to use the methods.
#
#
#


# Release 3: Reflect!
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
