/*
What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?
The important thing to know is that you need to have the name of your stylesheet saved, so that your html file knows which file to link to.

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?
We used float to position things right and left. We did have a lot of trouble getting the site to do what we wanted, particularly when trying to make horizontal dividers without using <hr>. We tried every variation of editing a div we could think of or find, but nothing would work at all.

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)
We used font-size, font-color, and font-style, for example.

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you chose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?
We added a few classes to the HTML, because classes are good for editing several elements within a file, as opposed to ids, which are better suited to single elements.

When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?
I think ours was cleaner, since we were able to create a similar result without formatting a large table. We were able to create two columns without formatting everything into a table, which can be ungainly.
