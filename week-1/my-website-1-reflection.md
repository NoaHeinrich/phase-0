#Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person. First, log in to gitHub.com, and click the button that says “Create New Repository.” At the next page, you name it, pick who can see it and use it, and then click “Create Repository”. Next, copy the url of the repository. Then, open up your command line interface, and type “git clone <url>”. And boom, your repository is now available to you on your own computer.

#Describe what open source means.
#Open Source is a way of doing business, and a philosophy. If a program is Open Source, then it's code is available for anybody to use and edit as they see fit, without having to credit the original maker.
#What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
#Personally, I think open source is good for some, but not for everybody. Some types of code are perfect for open source, since they can do a lot of people good. But other types of code are more specialized, and so the creator might depend on revenue from that code.

#Assess the importance of using licenses.
#Licenses are important because they allow you to share your code with others, but still retain your rights as the creator. For example, if you want to share your code publicly, but want to make sure your work is acknowledged, you might want to use a Creative Commons license.

#What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
#This challenge made me more comfortable with pushing and pulling from gitHub. When I did the last challenge, it made my head spin a bit, but pushing my code to the website felt much more natural this time around. I did have a moment when I accidentally saved the code on sublime before switching to a new branch. This gave me some difficulty, but I managed to figure out how to correct it.

#Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
#I was able to use git-scm.com for some advice on how to undo items that you staged by accident.
